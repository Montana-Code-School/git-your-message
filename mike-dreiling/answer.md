Friday night I will go to a wedding. Saturday I will be doing some cleaning and organizing. Sunday I'll go to church and then would like to take it easy afterward if I can get away with it.

Vue.js is a JS library for building user interfaces. It is a simple and very clean library that allows users to create simple scripts and reusable components for clean and simple solutions, but it has also been known to power fairly complex Single Page Applications.

Vue does support state in a way similiar to React, but it is simpler.  So it does tie the DOM and the state of the app together, but it cannot be used for overly complicated apps or state involvement like React and Angular can.

So a programmer would use Vue instead of React for small solutions like a nice reactive form but not a full blown web application.
