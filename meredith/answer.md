I do not have a question :( so I will answer this: It seems to me that GraphQL is an interface between client and server to retrieve information requested by the client from a database....eh?

#Interview Question 8/8
The Box Model refers to the design and layout on a page. Every HTML element is wrapped in a box. It consists of content, padding, border and margin. Content is the actual text or images, padding is the transparent area of space around the content, the border goes around the padding and content, and margin is a transparent area of space around the outside of the border. You can change the box model by changing the size of each property, either in px, em, or rem. Margin, border and padding can be set for each sides of the box...i.e.-
margin-top, margin-right, margin-left, margin-bottom, etc. Additionally, borders have many different properties, including border-width, border-style, and border-color.
